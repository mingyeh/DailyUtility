# DailyUtility
DailyUtility project is used to contain the scripts I use in daily work.

As you might know, there are lots of routines in our daily works, like copy some product numbers from Excel file(s), and search them in database... I'd admit some of them are quite boring and time consuming. That's reason I started this project. The aim is to delegate the steps that requires no human intelligence to dear Python.
